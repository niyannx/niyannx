- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niyannx. I'm a student at Professional High School of Computing and Technology Systems - Pravets, Bulgaria;
I'm 17 years old.

- Currently learning Java Script (SoftUni, JavaScript Advanced), Java, a bit of PHP, HTML, Linux and other tech (mainly at school). Join me on my journey and watch as I grow!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things about development and programming, both back-end and front-end.
I know I have a lot to learn, but I'm motivated and a hard-worker.
