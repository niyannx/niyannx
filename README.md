I'm 17 years old.

- Currently learning Java (at SoftUni, currently in the Java Advanced class), and a bit of PHP, HTML and other tech (mainly at school).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things about development and programming, both back-end and front-end.
I know I have a lot to learn, but I'm motivated and a hard-worker.
